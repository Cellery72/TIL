TodayILearned
=============
#####TIL is a repo consisting of the new stuff I learn on a day to day basis in a wide variety of subjects. For the most part they're software development related or atleast technology related.. or perhaps not. 

I got inspiration for this project after reading [a post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11068902) on HackerNews about this exact idea. I love the idea of keeping an ever growing collection of the things you learn on a daily basis. As a student, who also works in industry this is going to become a large collection of explanation/small bits of code pertaining to the topic at hand.
